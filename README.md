### Project Description
Not in the mood? We got your excuse. AwayZone is a quirky yet clever mobile app designed to help you dodge unwanted interactions with style. Packed with features like fake calls, fake app crash, hilarious auto-excuses and glitched screens, it turns social avoidance into a fun, gamified experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In our always-online world, we‚Äôre constantly bombarded with calls, texts, and ‚Äúurgent‚Äù pings‚Äîeven when we‚Äôre in the middle of working, eating, napping, or simply existing in peace. Friends expect instant replies, bosses assume we‚Äôre always available, and family thinks ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù is just a suggestion. The tragedy? There‚Äôs no dramatic, over-the-top way to escape without feeling guilty. AwayZone solves this global crisis by giving you hilarious, believable, and utterly unnecessary tools to dodge every social interaction like a pro.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
AwayZone offers a lighthearted yet innovative approach to managing unwanted digital and social interactions. Through features like customizable fake calls, automated funny excuses, phone crashes, and background noise distortion, it empowers users to create believable scenarios for stepping away from conversations without confrontation. By combining playful creativity with practical tools, AwayZone transforms the act of ‚Äúbeing unavailable‚Äù into a polished, seamless, and even entertaining experience.

Customizable Fake Calls ‚Äì Simulate incoming calls to create a natural reason to step away.

Phone Crashes ‚Äì Trigger a realistic "device malfunction" to make unavailability believable.

Automated Funny Excuses ‚Äì Generate witty, context-appropriate reasons to exit forced conversations.

Noise Distortion ‚Äì Introduce simulated background noise and artificial audio glitches to mimic poor network quality or a busy environment, creating a believable reason for disrupted or shortened conversations.
